        <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <p class="formula f1">ax + b = 0</p>  
        <p>where <span id="litera"><b>a</b></span> and <span id="litera"><b>b</b></span> are real numbers 
        and <span id="litera"><b>x</b></span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the 
        standard form of a linear equation. Note that most 
        linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may 
        or may not be an <span id="litera"><b>x</b></span> so dont get too locked into always 
        seeing an <span id="litera"><b>x</b></span> there.</p>

        <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>

        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

          <p class="formula f2">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>  

<p>where <span id="litera"><b>a</b></span>, <span id="litera"><b>b</b></span>, <span id="litera"><b>c</b></span> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.</p>

<h4>The area of a circle (A</h4>)

[sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:

  A = [sign] [sign] r^2  

or, when you know the diameter (D):
  A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D^2  

or, when you know the circumference (C):
  A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign] 

<h4>Intersection</h4>

The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,

  A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }  

That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
